## About

offvsix is a command-line utility written in Go that can
download Visual Studio Code extensions (.vsix files) directly
from the Visual Studio Marketplace. This project is inspired by
the Python-based [offvsix](https://github.com/gni/offvsix) tool
of the same name but this copy is rewritten in Go.
